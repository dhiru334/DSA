a) Declare a calendar as an array of 7 elements (A dynamically Created array) to represent 7 days of a week. Each Element of the array is a structure having three fields. The first field is the name of the Day (A dynamically allocated String), The second field is the date of the Day (A integer), the third field is the description of the activity for a particular day (A dynamically allocated String).
b) Write functions create(), read() and display(); to create the calendar, to read the data from the keyboard and to print weeks activity details report on screen.


#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <string.h> 
typedef struct { 
 char *name;  
 int date; 
 char *description; 
} Day; 
void create(Day *week, int size) { 
 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {  
 week[i].name = (char *)malloc(20 * sizeof(char));  
 week[i].description = (char *)malloc(100 * sizeof(char)); 
 } 
} 
void read(Day *week, int size) { 
 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { 
 printf("Enter name of day %d: ", i + 1); 
 scanf("%s", week[i].name); 
 printf("Enter date: "); 
 scanf("%d", &week[i].date); 
 printf("Enter description: "); 
 scanf(" %[^\n]", week[i].description);  
including spaces 
 } 
} 
void display(Day *week, int size) { 
 printf("\nWeek's Activity Details:\n"); 
 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { 
 printf("Day: %s, Date: %d, Activity: %s\n", week[i].name, 
week[i].date, week[i].description); 
 } 
} 
int main() { 
 int size = 7;  
 Day *week = (Day *)malloc(size * sizeof(Day));  
allocate the array 
 create(week, size); 
 read(week, size); 
 display(week, size); 
 for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { 
 free(week[i].name); 
 free(week[i].description); 
 } 
 free(week); 
 return 0;
